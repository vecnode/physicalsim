# Architecture

physicalsim has two layers with a hard boundary between them: a native C++
shell that owns the window and the HTTP server, and a JS/TS layer that owns
every simulator. The native layer never simulates anything itself — it hosts
the browser engine the simulators run inside of, and exposes what happens
there over HTTP.

## Why it's split this way

The native shell ([webview](https://github.com/webview/webview) +
[cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) +
[cpp-embedlib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-embedlib)) is a thin,
deliberately dumb host: open a window (or don't), serve some embedded static
files, get out of the way. It doesn't know what a simulator is. Every actual
simulator — rp2040, avr8, and whatever gets added later — is a JS/TS library
running inside the webview's browser engine, because that's the only runtime
both simulator projects (rp2040js, avr8js) actually target, and because it
lets the exact same build serve identically to a plain browser tab pointed at
`localhost:<port>` or to the native window. See [README.md](README.md) for
the reasoning behind keeping the native shell as-is instead of moving to
Ultralight/CEF — this is an intentionally deferred tradeoff, not an
oversight.

## The three JS/TS layers

**`web/common`** — the contract everything else is built against
(`web/common/src/adapter-types.ts`):

```ts
interface SimulatorAdapter {
  readonly id: string;
  init(config: unknown): Promise<void>;
  start(): void;
  stop(): void;
  step(n: number): void;
  reset(): void;
  onStateChange(cb: (state: SimState) => void): () => void;
}
```

No firmware loading yet — deliberately. Right now `start`/`step` just runs
each adapter's CPU against whatever's already in its (empty) flash/program
memory; this stage is about the control-flow architecture working end to
end (C++ <-> JS <-> Worker <-> CPU), not real simulation output. Loading
(and exporting) firmware is a later addition to `SimulatorAdapter`.

Also home to `worker-host.ts` (`hostAdapter()`, wires any `SimulatorAdapter`
to the postMessage RPC protocol — every adapter's `worker.ts` is a two-line
file that just calls this).

**`web/adapters/{rp2040,avr8}`** — one package per simulator. Each
`adapter.ts` implements `SimulatorAdapter` against its library; each
`worker.ts` is the Worker entry point (`hostAdapter(new XAdapter())`). The
libraries themselves aren't npm dependencies — `rp2040js`/`avr8js` are
resolved via a Vite/tsconfig alias straight to
`simulators/<name>/src/index.ts` in the git submodule (see
`web/shell/vite.config.ts`). Adding a third simulator means: add a
submodule, add its alias, add an adapter package. Nothing else changes.

**`web/shell`** — the only page that actually gets served. Three files do
the coordinating:

- `adapter-registry.ts` — one `AdapterClient` (Worker + RPC client) per
  adapter id, created lazily and never torn down. This is the shared state:
  the UI and the native bridge both call `getAdapterClient(id)` and get the
  *same* running instance, so driving an adapter from one side is visible
  from the other.
- `main.ts` — the black/white control UI (adapter picker,
  start/stop/step/reset, live state readout).
- `native-bridge.ts` + `native-notify.ts` — the JS half of the native<->JS
  bridge (next section). Imported into `main.ts` for its side effect
  (registers `window.physicalsimBridge`); harmless in a plain browser tab,
  where `window.physicalsimReply` simply doesn't exist and calls no-op.

Each running adapter is isolated in its own Web Worker so one misbehaving
simulator can't freeze the shell UI, and communicates over a small
JSON-RPC-shaped `postMessage` protocol (`{id, method, params}` in,
`{id, result|error}` or an unsolicited `{event: "stateChange", state}` out —
see `web/common/src/adapter-types.ts`).

## The native <-> JS bridge

This exists so an external caller (droidcli) can drive a simulator by
talking to the C++ process over HTTP, without going through the browser UI
at all. droidcli -> C++ -> JS/TS is the whole point; the UI is one client of
the adapters, not a required intermediary.

Protocol, concretely:

1. `POST /bridge/rp2040/start` arrives on an httplib worker thread
   (`src/main.cpp`).
2. `dispatch_bridge_call()` registers a pending request under a fresh id,
   then calls `w.dispatch([&]{ w.eval(js); })` — `dispatch()` is the only
   webview call that's safe to invoke off the UI thread; it posts the
   `eval()` onto the UI thread's queue.
3. On the UI thread, `eval()` runs
   `window.physicalsimBridge.dispatch({id, adapter, method, params})` in the
   page. `native-bridge.ts` looks up the adapter via the shared registry,
   calls the matching `SimulatorAdapter` method, and reports the outcome
   back through `window.physicalsimReply(...)` — a webview `bind()`
   (`install_bridge()` in `main.cpp`), called once before `w.navigate()` so
   it's available from the very first page load.
4. The `physicalsimReply` C++ callback parses the JSON, matches it to the
   pending request by id, and notifies a condition variable.
5. Back on the httplib thread, `dispatch_bridge_call()` was blocked on that
   condition variable (5s timeout) and returns the result as the HTTP
   response.

`stateChange` events use the same `physicalsimReply` channel but
unsolicited (no pending request to match) — they update
`g_bridge_latest_state[adapter]`, which `GET /bridge/:adapter/state` reads.

**Why `--headless` still creates a webview window.** The adapters only run
inside the webview's embedded browser engine — there's nowhere else for
them to execute. `--headless` therefore still constructs and navigates a
real `webview::webview`, still calls `w.run()` (the message loop has to
pump for the browser engine to do anything), and just hides the window
(`ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)` / `gtk_widget_hide`) instead of skipping it. Shutdown
is a small dedicated thread that waits on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` and calls
`w.dispatch([&]{ w.terminate(); })` to stop `run()` from a safe thread.

**Why state-change forwarding is throttled.** A running adapter emits a
`stateChange` roughly every tick (every `STEPS_PER_TICK` cycles, effectively
continuously). Forwarding every single one to native means every one
round-trips through `eval()`/`bind()` on the UI thread — enough traffic to
starve a freshly-dispatched command long enough to hit the 5s timeout.
`adapter-registry.ts` throttles the *native* forwarding to 5/s per adapter;
the UI's own `onStateChange` subscribers still get every event, since only
the native round trip is expensive. See the README's "Known limitation" for
what this doesn't yet cover (multiple adapters running simultaneously under
heavy concurrent bridge traffic).

## Build pipeline

`public/` is never authored by hand — it's Vite's build output
(`web/shell/vite.config.ts` sets `build.outDir` to `../../public`,
`emptyOutDir: true`), embedded into the binary by `cpp-embedlib`
(`cpp_embedlib_add(WebAssets FOLDER public ...)` in `CMakeLists.txt`). Build
order is always: `npm install && npm run build` in `web/` first, then
`cmake -B build && cmake --build build`. All four build scripts
(`build_and_run.{sh,bat}`, `package_release.{sh,bat}`) do this automatically.

One non-obvious wrinkle worth knowing before touching `web/shell/vite.config.ts`:
both simulator submodules need `useDefineForClassFields: false` — several of
their classes assign fields that read sibling fields in the same constructor
pass, which is safe under legacy (assignment) class-field semantics but a
genuine use-before-init crash under native (spec) class fields, which is
what esbuild uses by default at Vite's target. This is set explicitly via
`esbuild.tsconfigRaw` in `vite.config.ts` rather than relying on each
submodule's own `tsconfig.json`, because Vite resolves TS options once for
the whole bundle rather than per vendored file. See the README's
"Dependencies" notes for the related stray-build-artifact hazard in the
submodules.
